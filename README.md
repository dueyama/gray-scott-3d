# Gray-Scott 3D

An educational browser app for exploring three-dimensional Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion patterns.

日本語: 3次元 Gray-Scott 反応拡散モデルのパターンをブラウザで観察するための教育向け Web アプリです。

## Overview

The Gray-Scott model is a reaction-diffusion system in which autocatalytic reaction terms and diffusion can generate rich spatial patterns. This app focuses on the three-dimensional case and renders regions where the concentration of `V` becomes visible.

The goal is public exploration rather than research-grade numerical analysis. The interface is designed for moving parameters, comparing presets, and seeing how 3D structures respond.

## Features

- 3D Gray-Scott simulation running in the browser
- Three.js / WebGL2 volume rendering
- Optional Marching Cubes isosurface view
- Adjustable `F`, `k`, display threshold, simulation speed, and boundary condition
- Neumann and periodic boundary modes
- Reproducible initial conditions using a seeded Mersenne Twister
- Japanese / English UI with `AUTO`, `EN`, and `JP` language modes
- Separate guide page with equations, parameter notes, and references

## Model

The web app uses an explicit finite-difference Euler update for the Gray-Scott equations:

```text
U_t = Du laplacian(U) - U V^2 + F(1 - U)
V_t = Dv laplacian(V) + U V^2 - (F + k)V
```

`U` and `V` are concentrations, `Du` and `Dv` are diffusion coefficients, `F` is the feed rate, and `k` is the removal rate.

## Initial Conditions and Presets

Most presets start from a nearly uniform field with `U=1` and `V=0`, plus one or more small localized seeds. Seed radius is perturbed by deterministic random noise so the same seed value can reproduce the same initial state.

Some presets use multiple spherical or elongated seeds to make three-dimensional behavior easier to inspect.

## Visualization

The main view is GPU volume raymarching with Three.js and WebGL2.

1. A Web Worker updates the 3D `U` and `V` fields.
2. The `V` field is quantized to `Uint8Array`.
3. The main thread uploads it as a `THREE.Data3DTexture`.
4. A fragment shader accumulates color and opacity above the visible threshold.
5. The isosurface mode uses the Three.js `MarchingCubes` addon to generate a mesh from the same `V` field.

Central XY, XZ, and YZ slice views are also shown as compact supporting views.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite usually serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. If that port is already in use, Vite may choose another port.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production build is written to `dist/`.

## Deployment on Vercel

This is a static Vite app. Import the repository into Vercel with the default Vite settings:

- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`
- Install Command: `npm install`

The app has two static entry pages, `/` and `/about.html`; no custom rewrite configuration is required.
